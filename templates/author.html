                                Mylene Leumin is a Nurse by profession and she is passionate with her work as an Intensive Care Unit
                                Nurse. Since 1999, she worked as a neonatal and a pediatric Nurse and now currently, she is practicing
                                as an adult nurse.

                                She shares an experience in her Kindergarten year which stems of her love for picture books.
                                Mylene remembers her Kindergarten teacher siting in front of the class, reading Rapunzel to
                                her and her classmates. The teacher held only the book for the class, flipping one page at a time to show the
                                pretty pictures to her and her classmates. Mylene recalls staring at the book but it was too
                                small, however, it had wonderful pictures. She remembers wishing she held the book, looked
                                at the pictures and touched the pages for as long as she could. She did not own a book of
                                fairytales, but her best friend let her borrow her two volumes of fairy tales. In the summer of
                                fourth grade, she read all the stories in the books.

                                Her background in writing extends from years in a Catholic school in high school as one of the
                                editors in the high school paper, Josephites. She wrote poems that were published both in the
                                high school and the University school papers. In her final year in Nursing, she was chosen as
                                the Editor-in-Chief of the College of Nursing yearbook Class of 1993, the Nemesis. Years ago,
                                she studied writing courses in the U.S. to earn her diploma for Writing for Children and
                                Teenagers. She eventually paused on writing, until her son went through her stories that had failed
                                submissions. He read them, and he asked if she could publish them. This generated the idea and motivated
                                Mylene to do it.

                                The Tales of POTOS (Pearl of the Orient Seas) books are her first books ever published. With her
                                artistic talent, she works with the illustrator, Stephanie, on the facial expressions, body
                                language, and settings of her books.

                                Publishing her books not only but gives her the freedom to edit and work on each page, but
                                Mylene is sharing her books for children to enjoy and to gain moral lessons from.
